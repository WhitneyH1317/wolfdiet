This repository includes codes and information to develop a **PostgreSQL Database** containing the studies carried out on wolf's feeding ecology throughout its distribution range. The database is open access, and the aim is to inspire researchers in participating in data collection, promoting teamwork between Asian, European, and American researchers. Currently, researchers from Romania, Italy, and the Netherlands are collaborating in developing the database.

The repository is divided in subdirectories:  

* **[db_structure](https://github.com/andreacorra/WolfDiet/tree/master/db_structure)**: Database structure (SQL code and functions for creating the database)
* **[bibliography](https://github.com/andreacorra/WolfDiet/tree/master/bibliography)**: List of articles reviewed in the study
* **[images](https://github.com/andreacorra/WolfDiet/tree/master/images)**: List of the images used in the GitHub page

A more comprehensive description of the database is available at the [wiki](https://github.com/andreacorra/WolfDiet/wiki) page.
